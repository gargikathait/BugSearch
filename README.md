# BugSearch

BugSearch is a web-based Q&A platform designed for developers. Much like Stack Overflow, it enables users to:

Ask technical questions
Post answers and solutions
Browse an extensive question-answer library
Interact with the community
It provides a user-friendly interface where programmers can help each other debug code, learn new skills, and share knowledge about a wide variety of programming topics â€” from languages like Python and Java to tools like Git, frameworks, IDEs, and more.
